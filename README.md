# Lattice-Boltzmann-Simulation - Python

Description
-A Python-based simulation using the Lattice Boltzmann Method to model fluid flow around a cylindrical obstacle. The project demonstrates the basics of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with visual outputs of velocity fields.

Features
-Simulates fluid flow in a 2D lattice.
-Visualizes velocity magnitudes over time.
-Adjustable parameters for viscosity, lattice size, and obstacle geometry.
