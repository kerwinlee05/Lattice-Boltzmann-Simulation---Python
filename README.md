# Lattice-Boltzmann-Simulation - Python


A Python-based simulation using the Lattice Boltzmann Method to model fluid flow around a cylindrical obstacle. The project demonstrates the basics of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with visual outputs of velocity fields.

This code simulates fluid flow in a 2D lattice, visualizes velocity magnitudes over time, adjustable parameters for viscosity, lattice size, and obstacle geometry.
